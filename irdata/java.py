"""
Very limited support for Java object serialisation.

This functionality is only needed for iRefScape export, which for some reason
uses this representation instead of a plain text representation. Although a
general serialiser could be used, the output of previous data files was
deconstructed instead and the immutable sections from such files are reproduced
here.
